# AudioClassifier_RNN_CNN
Classify audio with Keras using RNN's or CNN's


Easily classifiy your audio libraries with this handy repo!

1. You will first to generate your metadata for the files. Easily use the metaDataGen.py to do this.
   Here a video tutorial for this using this file: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADqt8fsTzno
   
2. Modify the ML.py file ot your needs. This is built for 2 label data set, this can easily be modified by changing the size of the Dense      layers. Simply scale them in the needed factor to where the final Dense layer is the number of labels or object types you have.
